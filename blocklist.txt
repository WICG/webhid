// This file holds a list of filters to match devices, collections, and
// reports that websites using the WebHID API are forbidden from accessing.
//
// Each filter rule may specify device-level properties (vendor, product),
// top-level-collection properties (usagePage, usage), and report
// properties (reportId, reportType). All of the properties for a filter
// rule must match for the rule to apply. Omitted properties match any
// value.
//
// Examples:
//   // Blocks access to all devices from vendor BABE.
//   {vendor:0xBABE},
//   // Blocks access to product BAAD from vendor 6666.
//   {vendor:0x6666, product:0xBAAD},
//   // Blocks access to reports contained in top-level collections with
//   // vendor-defined usage page 0xFF00 on products from vendor DADA.
//   {vendor:0xDADA, usagePage:0xFF00},
//   // Blocks access to feature reports on all products from vendor B0BA.
//   {vendor:0xB0BA, reportType:"feature"},
//   // Blocks access to input, output, and feature reports with report ID
//   // 0x42 on product 1234 from vendor ABCD.
//   {vendor:0xABCD, product:0x1234, reportId:0x42},
